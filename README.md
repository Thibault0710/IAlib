# IAlib

*A basic C++ library for machine learning using Eigen3 and Google Test (gtest).*

Before running the test files, please **unzip the `test/MNIST.zip` file**.

## Implemented Algorithms

This library includes implementations of several fundamental machine learning algorithms:

- **K-means** (clustering)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (classification)
- **Classic Linear Regression** (regression)
- **Logistic Regression** (binary classification)
- **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms (classification and regression)
- **Neural Networks**
  - 1D (fully connected layers)
  - 2D (for image-based data)
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (for deep learning)
